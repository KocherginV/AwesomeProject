# AwesomeProject
Coursework done during [React Native course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/react-native-v2/) from Frontend Masters. <br /> The app purpose is to show different
color palettes. Tap on the palette will lead to the palette details view. Also user can create own color palette, select colors and it would be shown on top of the palettes list. The newly
created palette wouldn't be shown in other session (i.e., no POST request to the API with the new palette is done).
